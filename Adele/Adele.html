				[Verse 1]
				<br>
				Hello, it's me
				<br>
				I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet
				<br>
				To go over everything
				<br>
				They say that time's supposed to heal ya, but I ain't done much healing
				<br>
				Hello, can you hear me?
				<br>
				I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
				<br>
				When we were younger and free
				<br>
				I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet
				<br>
				<br>
				[Pre-Chorus 1]
				<br>
				There's such a difference between us
				<br>
				And a million miles
				<br>
				<br>
				[Chorus]
				<br>
				Hello from the other side
				<br>
				I must've called a thousand times
				<br>
				To tell you, I'm sorry for everything that I've done
				<br>
				But when I call, you never seem to be home
				<br>
				Hello from the outside
				<br>
				At least, I can say that I've tried
				<br>
				To tell you, I'm sorry for breaking your heart
				<br>
				But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore
				<br>
				<br>
				[Verse 2]
				<br>
				Hello, how are you?
				<br>
				It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
				<br>
				I hope that you're well
				<br>
				Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened?
				<br>
				<br>
				[Pre-Chorus 2]
				<br>
				It's no secret that the both of us
				<br>
				Are running out of time
				<br>
				<br>
				[Chorus]
				<br>
				So hello from the other side
				<br>
				I must've called a thousand times
				<br>
				To tell you, I'm sorry for everything that I've done
				<br>
				But when I call, you never seem to be home
				<br>
				Hello from the outside
				<br>
				At least, I can say that I've tried
				<br>
				To tell you, I'm sorry for breaking your heart	
				<br>
				But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore
				<br>
				<br>
				[Bridge]
				<br>
				(Highs, highs, highs, highs, lows, lows, lows, lows)
				<br>
				Ooh, anymore
				<br>
				(Highs, highs, highs, highs, lows, lows, lows, lows)
				<br>
				Ooh, anymore
				<br>
				(Highs, highs, highs, highs, lows, lows, lows, lows)
				<br>
				Ooh, anymore
				<br>
				(Highs, highs, highs, highs, lows, lows, lows, lows)
				<br>
				Anymore
				<br>
				<br>
				[Chorus]
				<br>
				Hello from the other side
				<br>
				I must've called a thousand times
				<br>
				To tell you, I'm sorry for everything that I've done
				<br>
				But when I call, you never seem to be home
				<br>
				Hello from the outside
				<br>
				At least, I can say that I've tried
				<br>
				To tell you, I'm sorry for breaking your heart
				<br>
				But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore
