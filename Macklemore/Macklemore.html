				[Intro: Macklemore]
				<br>
				Hey, hey, hey
				<br>
				Good to see you
				<br>
				Come on, dude, let's go
				<br>
				Yeah! Let's go!
				<br>
				Ha-ha-ha-ha alright
				<br>
				Alright, okay
				<br>
				Alright, okay
				<br>
				Alright, okay
				<br>
				<br>
				[Verse 1: Macklemore]
				<br>
				Return of the Mack
				<br>
				Get 'em, what it is, what it does, what it is, what it isn't
				<br>
				Looking for a better way to get up outta bed
				<br>
				Instead of getting on the Internet
				<br>
				And checking on who hit me, get up
				<br>
				Thrift shop, pimp-strut walkin'
				<br>
				Little bit of humble, little bit of cautious
				<br>
				Somewhere between like Rocky and Cosby
				<br>
				Sweater game, nope nope, y'all can't copy, yeah
				<br>
				Bad, moonwalking, this here is our party
				<br>
				My posse's been on Broadway, and we did it our way
				<br>
				Grown music, I shed my skin and put my bones
				<br>
				Into everything I record to it and yet I'm on
				<br>
				Let that stage light go and shine on down
				<br>
				Got that Bob Barker suit game and Plinko in my style
				<br>
				Money, stay on my craft and stick around for those pounds
				<br>
				But I do that to pass the torch and put on for my town
				<br>
				Trust me on my I-N-D-E-P-E-N-D-E-N-T shit, hustlin'
				<br>
				Chasing dreams since I was fourteen
				<br>
				With the four-track, bussin'
				<br>
				Halfway cross that city with the backpack, fat cat, crushin'
				<br>
				Labels out here, now they can't tell me nothin' (Hey, hey, hey)
				<br>
				We give that to the people, spread it across the country (Hey, hey, hey, oh)
				<br>
				Labels out here, now they can't tell me nothin' (Hey, hey, hey)
				<br>
				We give it to the people, spread it across the country (Hey, hey, hey, oh)
				<br>
				<br>
				[Chorus: Ray Dalton]
				<br>
				Can we go back? This is the moment
				<br>
				Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
				<br>
				So we put our hands up
				<br>
				Like the ceiling can't hold us
				<br>
				Like the ceiling can't hold us
				<br>
				Can we go back? This is the moment
				<br>
				Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
				<br>
				So we put our hands up
				<br>
				Like the ceiling can't hold us
				<br>
				Like the ceiling can't hold us
				<br>
				<br>
				[Verse 2: Macklemore]
				<br>
				Now, can I kick it? Thank you
				<br>
				Yeah, I'm so damn grateful
				<br>
				I grew up really wanting gold fronts
				<br>
				But thatâ€™s what you get when Wu-Tang raised you
				<br>
				Y'all can't stop me
				<br>
				Go hard like I got a 808 in my heartbeat
				<br>
				And I'm eating at the beat like you gave a little speed
				<br>
				To a great white shark on Shark Week, raw!
				<br>
				Time to go off, I'm gone
				<br>
				Deuces, goodbye, I got a world to see
				<br>
				And my girl, she wanna see Rome
				<br>
				Caesar'll make you a believer
				<br>
				Nah, I never ever did it for a throne
				<br>
				That validation comes from giving it back to the people
				<br>
				Now sing a song, and it goes like
				<br>
				Raise those hands, this is our party (Hey, hey, hey)
				<br>
				We came here to live life like nobody was watching (Hey, hey, hey, oh)
				<br>
				I got my city right behind me, if I fall, they got me (Hey, hey, hey)
				<br>
				Learn from that failure, gain humility (Hey, hey, hey)
				<br>
				And then we keep marching, I said
				<br>
				<br>
				[Chorus: Ray Dalton]
				<br>
				Can we go back? This is the moment
				<br>
				Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
				<br>
				So we put our hands up
				<br>
				Like the ceiling can't hold us
				<br>
				Like the ceiling can't hold us
				<br>
				Can we go back? This is the moment
				<br>
				Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
				<br>
				So we put our hands up
				<br>
				Like the ceiling can't hold us
				<br>
				Like the ceiling can't hold us
				<br>
				<br>
				[Interlude]
				<br>
				And so we put our hands up
				<br>
				And so we put our hands up
				<br>
				Whoa, whoa, whoa
				<br>
				<br>
				[Bridge: Ray Dalton and Macklemore]
				<br>
				Na na na na, na na na na (Huh-uh)
				<br>
				Hey (And all my people sing)
				<br>
				Na na na na, na na na na (Hey, hey, that's right)
				<br>
				Hey (Here we go, all right, uh)
				<br>
				And all my people sing
				<br>
				Na na na na, na na na na (You do it, Ray)
				<br>
				Oh (Ha-ha, let's go)
				<br>
				And all my people sing
				<br>
				Na na na na, na na na na
				<br>
				Mack-le-e-e-e-e-more!
				<br>
				<br>
				[Chorus: Ray Dalton]
				<br>
				Can we go back? This is the moment
				<br>
				Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
				<br>
				So we put our hands up
				<br>
				Like the ceiling can't hold us
				<br>
				Like the ceiling can't hold us
				<br>
				Can we go back? This is the moment (Ooh)
				<br>
				Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over (Ooh)
				<br>
				So we put our hands up (Ooh)
				<br>
				Like the ceiling can't hold us (Ooh)
				<br>
				Like the ceiling can't hold us (Ooh)
