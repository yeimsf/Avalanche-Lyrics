				[Intro: Ed Sheeran]
				<br>
				We are, we are, we are
				<br>
				<br>
				[Verse 1: Ed Sheeran]
				<br>
				L.A. on a Saturday night in the summer
				<br>
				Sundown and they all come out
				<br>
				Lamborghinis and their rented Hummers
				<br>
				The party's on, so they're headin' downtown ('Round here)
				<br>
				Everybody's lookin' for a come up
				<br>
				And they wanna know what you're about
				<br>
				Me in the middle with the one I love and
				<br>
				We're just tryna figure everything out
				<br>
				<br>
				[Pre-Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
				<br>
				We don't fit in well 'cause we are just ourselves
				<br>
				I could use some help gettin' out of this conversation, yeah
				<br>
				You look stunning, dear, so don't ask that question here
				<br>
				This is my only fear: that we become
				<br>
				<br>
				[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
				<br>
				Beautiful people
				<br>
				Drop top, designer clothes
				<br>
				Front row at fashion shows
				<br>
				"What d'you do?" and "Who d'you know?"
				<br>
				Inside the world of beautiful people
				<br>
				Champagne and rolled-up notes
				<br>
				Prenups and broken homes
				<br>
				Surrounded, but still alone
				<br>
				Let's leave the party
				<br>
				<br>
				[Post-Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
				<br>
				That's not who we are (We are, we are, we are)
				<br>
				We are not beautiful
				<br>
				Yeah, that's not who we are (We are, we are, we are)
				<br>
				We are not beautiful (Beautiful)
				<br>
				<br>
				[Verse 2: Khalid]
				<br>
				L.A., mmm, drove for hours last night and we made it nowhere (Nowhere, nowhere)
				<br>
				I see stars in your eyes when we're halfway there (All night)
				<br>
				I'm not fazed by all them lights and flashin' cameras
				<br>
				'Cause with my arms around you, there's no need to care
				<br>
				<br>
				[Pre-Chorus: Khalid]
				<br>
				We don't fit in well, we are just ourselves
				<br>
				I could use some help gettin' out of this conversation, yeah
				<br>
				You look stunning, dear, so don't ask that question here
				<br>
				This is my only fear: that we become
				<br>
				<br>
				[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
				<br>
				Beautiful people
				<br>
				Drop top, designer clothes
				<br>
				Front row at fashion shows
				<br>
				"What d'you do?" and "Who d'you know?"
				<br>
				Inside the world of beautiful people
				<br>
				Champagne and rolled-up notes
				<br>
				Prenups and broken homes
				<br>
				Surrounded, but still alone
				<br>
				Let's leave the party
				<br>
				<br>
				[Post-Chorus: Ed Sheeran, Both, Khalid]
				<br>
				That's not who we are (We are, we are, we are)
				<br>
				We are not beautiful, yeah
				<br>
				Yeah, that's not who we are (We are, we are, we are)
				<br>
				We are not beautiful (Beautiful)
				<br>
				<br>
				[Outro: Ed Sheeran]
				<br>
				We are, we are, we are
				<br>
				We are not beautiful
