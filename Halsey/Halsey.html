				[Verse 1]
				<br>
				Found you when your heart was broke
				<br>
				I filled your cup until it overflowed
				<br>
				Took it so far to keep you close (Keep you close)
				<br>
				I was afraid to leave you on your own
				<br>
				<br>
				[Pre-Chorus]
				<br>			
				I said I'd catch you if you fall (Fall)
				<br>		
				And if they laugh, then fuck 'em all (All)
				<br>	
				And then I got you off your knees
				<br>
				Put you right back on your feet
				<br>
				Just so you could take advantage of me
				<br>
				<br>
				[Chorus]
				<br>			
				Tell me, how's it feel sittin' up there?
				<br>
				Feelin' so high, but too far away to hold me
				<br>
				You know I'm the one who put you up there
				<br>
				Name in the sky, does it ever get lonely?
				<br>
				Thinking you could live without me
				<br>
				Thinking you could live without me
				<br>
				Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
				<br>
				I don't know why (Yeah, I don't know why)
				<br>
				Thinking you could live without me
				<br>
				Live without me
				<br>
				Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
				<br>
				I don't know why (I don't know why, yeah, yeah)
				<br>
				<br>
				[Verse 2]
				<br>
				Gave love 'bout a hundred tries (Hundred tries)
				<br>
				Just running from the demons in your mind
				<br>
				Then I took yours and made 'em mine (Mine)
				<br>
				I didn't notice 'cause my love was blind
				<br>
				<br>
				[Pre-Chorus]
				<br>
				Said I'd catch you if you fall (Fall)
				<br>
				And if they laugh, then fuck 'em all (All)
				<br>
				And then I got you off your knees
				<br>
				Put you right back on your feet
				<br>
				Just so you could take advantage of me
				<br>
				<br>
				[Chorus]
				<br>
				Tell me, how's it feel sittin' up there?
				<br>
				Feelin' so high but too far away to hold me
				<br>
				You know I'm the one who put you up there
				<br>
				Name in the sky, does it ever get lonely?
				<br>
				Thinking you could live without me
				<br>
				Thinking you could live without me
				<br>
				Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
				<br>
				I don't know why (Yeah, I don't know why)
				<br>
				Thinking you could live without me
				<br>
				Live without me
				<br>
				Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
				<br>
				I don't know why, yeah
				<br>
				<br>
				[Bridge]
				<br>
				You don't have to say just what you did (What you did)
				<br>
				I already know (I know)
				<br>
				I had to go and find out from them (Oh-woah)
				<br>
				So tell me, how's it feel? (Oh-woah)
				<br>
				<br>
				[Chorus]
				<br>
				Tell me, how's it feel sittin' up there?
				<br>
				Feelin' so high, but too far away to hold me
				<br>
				You know I'm the one who put you up there
				<br>
				Name in the sky, does it ever get lonely?
				<br>
				Thinking you could live without me
				<br>
				Thinking you could live without me
				<br>
				Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
				<br>
				I don't know why (Yeah, I don't know why)
