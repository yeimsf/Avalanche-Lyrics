				<h2 style="text-align: center; color: white; font-family: olde;">Avalanche brings music intelligence to the masses.</h2>
				<p>
					<br>
					Founded in 2019, Avalanche is a unique media company that’s powered by community,
					<br> 
					our in-house creative team, and the artists themselves.
					<br>
					<br> 
					We serve music knowledge to over 100 million people each month on Avalanche.com and everywhere music fans connect across the internet.
					<br>
					<br>
					Avalanche started as a platform for annotating clever rap lyrics—our original name was Rap Avalanche.
					<br>
					<br> 
					Over the years, we’ve expanded our mission to include more than hip-hop, and more than just lyrics.
					<br>
					<br>
					Every song has a story that needs to be told,
					<br> 
					and the biggest names in music—including Ed Sheeran, Avril Lavgine, and camila cabello—come to Avalanche to give the world insight into their art.
					<br>
					<br>
					The Avalanche community has grown into an influential force of over 2 million contributors, editors, and musicians
					<br>
					<br>
					who sign up to discuss and deconstruct their favorite songs with fans all around the world.
					<br>
					<br> 
					As a result of their collective music IQ,
					<br> 
					we have the best lyrics and knowledge database on the internet—that’s over 25 million songs, albums, artists, and annotations.
					<br>
					<br>
					The in-house creative team at Avalanche spotlights the stories behind the music that matter most.
					<br>
					<br> 
					They work with artists and the community to transform insider knowledge into videos, events, in-depth features, breaking news coverage, and a variety of music knowledge content for the masses.
